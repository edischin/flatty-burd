Game Development study with Lua and LÃ–VE

## The Game
Horizontal scrolling game in which you control a "flatty" bird dodging pipes coming from the ground and the sky, while also avoidind hitting the ground or going to far off in the sky.
Game stops when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, and also when the bird goes to far from the top of the screen.
Pipes shall pop up in random intervals with random gaps between the top and bottom ones.
Player may control the bird with the 'space bar', each press causing the bird to jump (fly) on the air. If the bird don't jump (fly) it will fall directly to the ground.
One point is earned for each avoided pair of pipes.
Game may be paused and unpaused by pressing the 'P' key, and closed by pressing the 'Esc' key.
Highscore is kept only during the current game session, so it resets when game is closed.
Player may win a bronze, silver or gold medal based on the final score.
